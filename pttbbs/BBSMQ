this is the experimental branch of ptt code with zmq.

currently it does very minimum to see if this is a practical solution,
in terms of performance and footprint, for making ptt code more
distributed and service-oriented.

the current code does the following:

- it injects a zmq_poll call in dogetch of io.c, which is the main
  blocking call (from vkey()).  once igetch() is merged with
  vkey_poll, we can use zmq_poll as the main polling function.

- when user a tries to send a message to user b, it connects to the
  zmq socket user b is listening and sends a empty message.

- for each process, it listens to ipc:///tmp/write/$pid for write
  requests.  an empty message is sent by the message caller, no
  message is transmitted yet.

to use it, rebuild with -DBBSMQ and mkdir /tmp/write

ROADMAP

- make write function send actual message over the zmq channel instead
  of writing directly to shm.

- split the board r/w logic into a req/rep pattern of messaging. use
  inproc://board.$boardname for now.  we can then make some of the
  loaded boards off the main server by simply switching to tcp://.

- make a global/shared pub/sub zmq channel.  we can have enveloped messages like:
  "message.$username"
  "global.message"
  "newpost.$boardname"
  "newcomment.$boardname.$article"
  etc.

MESSAGE PATTERN SKETCH

- each processs should open two zmq socket:

  - req/rep sock to be served by workers through a queue device, making api calls to database or game services

  - pub/sub for push notification such as message, new article or comment of subscription, etc.
